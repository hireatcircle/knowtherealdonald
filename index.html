                        <p class="lead">Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York. He is a
                            businessman, television personality, and the 45th President of the United States. Trump is
                            known for his outspoken style, his business acumen, and his successful, albeit
                            controversial, presidency.</p>
                        <p>Trump's early career began in the family business, the Trump Organization, where he built a
                            portfolio of real estate holdings. He expanded the business significantly, taking it to new
                            heights and becoming one of the most well-known figures in American business.</p>
                        <p>In 2016, Trump ran as the Republican candidate for President of the United States and won
                            against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. His presidency focused on issues like
                            immigration reform, tax cuts, deregulation, and a "America First" foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>In the 2020 election, Trump was defeated by Joe Biden, but he continued to exert significant
                            influence in the political landscape. As of now, he is preparing for his potential return in
                            the 2024 elections as a candidate for the 47th President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Trump's legacy is defined by his unorthodox approach to politics, his polarizing public
                            persona, and his continued involvement in the political sphere.</p>
